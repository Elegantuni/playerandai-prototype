# playerandai-prototype

For windows you will need in msys2 launching from shortcut mingw64.exe in the msys2 install directory:
ncurses
openssl-devel (needed if you want to choose a seed 'example from cmd: playerandai1.exe "This is better now"')
mingw-w64-x8__64-toolchain
base-devel
pkg-config

For windows in msys2 you can install them using:
pacman -S ncurses openssl-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain base-devel pkg-config
